# Calculator

Calculator using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript.

In javascript, I have used the approach of class. where I created calculator class, basically its an object which has its own properties abd methods which it can perform when called upon. So I find this approach very logical and straight forward.

In CSS, I have used grids which makes sense since we can think buttons and displays as grid elements.
